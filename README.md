# Quiz App ReadMe 🧠🚀

## Overview

Welcome to the Quiz App! This application is designed to challenge your knowledge in various categories such as Science, Math, History, Geography, and Sports. Whether you're looking to test your expertise or learn something new, this app has got you covered. 🌐

## User Journey 🚶‍♂️🛤️

### Home Page 🏠

Upon launching the Quiz App, you'll find yourself on the home page. Here, you can choose from a selection of categories by clicking on the respective buttons:

- Science 🧪🔬
- Math 🧮➕➖
- History 📜🕰️
- Geography 🌍🗺️
- Sports ⚽🏀🎾

The app is designed to let you toggle between categories seamlessly. Clicking on a category button will highlight it as the chosen category and activate the "Play" button. The "Play" button will remain inactive until a category is selected. This ensures a clear and straightforward user experience.

### Quiz Pages 📝📚

After selecting a category and clicking the "Play" button, you will be directed to the quiz page corresponding to your chosen category. There are currently five categories available, each with its unique set of questions:

- Science 🧬🔍
- Math ➗✖️
- History 🗿📖
- Geography 🌐🌏
- Sports 🏅🏈

The quiz pages share a common structure and functionality. They include the following features:

#### Question Display 📊❓

Each quiz page displays a series of questions related to the selected category. Users can navigate through the questions and choose their answers.

#### Progress Indicator 🔄📈

A progress indicator at the top of the quiz page shows the user's progress, indicating the current question number out of the total questions in the quiz.

#### Navigation Buttons ⏪⏩

Users can move forward and backward through the questions using navigation buttons. The app ensures a smooth and intuitive flow during the quiz.

#### Timeout Functionality ⏱️❗

To add an element of challenge, each question comes with a time limit. If the user fails to answer a question within the specified time, the quiz will stop and give you options to return to the homepage or try again.

#### Results 🏆📊

Upon completing the quiz, users will receive their results, including the number of correct and incorrect answers. This feedback provides a summary of their performance.

## JavaScript Implementation 🚀💻

The application's functionality is driven by JavaScript. The home page script (`index.js`) manages category selection and the activation of the "Play" button. Each category is associated with a specific quiz page, and the `determineLink` function dynamically generates the link based on the chosen category.

The quiz pages (e.g., `science-quiz.js`, `maths-quiz.js`, etc.) share a common structure. The JavaScript code for these pages manages question display, user input, result calculation, and the timeout functionality.
